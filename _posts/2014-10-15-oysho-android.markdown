#### The app
With the first Oysho Android app in the market I could make my first approach to the Android development world.

#### What I learned
This app was a real challenge for me as my Android background was very limited. Despite the difficulties with lot of study and a little help we finished creating a nice app meeting client expectations.
We developed in parallel the Android core library for Inditex projects. This library is used nowadays in all the Android projects in the company.
I develop the library on my own which made my understanding of eCommerce business processes in the company grow a lot

#### Tech
- Android SDK
