#### The website
We build Massimo Dutti first responsive website. It was a real challenge to mix a good performance with the design proposed.

#### What I learned?
I decided to build this site following a component based architecture following the latest and more modern patterns and practices. The result was a fast and highly customizable site with a complicated responsive flow.

While developing this site we decided to create a core library for future uses which can help us with a speedier development sprints. We introduce this library in another sites while developing new features with success.
