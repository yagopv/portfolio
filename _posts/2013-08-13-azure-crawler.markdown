#### What is this?
If you are creating applications using  modern JavaScript frameworks like Angular you probably already know that this type of apps are not crawlable by search engines without a couple of extra steps.

Azure Crawler exposes a REST API built on top of ASP MVC and excecutes a phantom headless browser allowing to crawl pages and render the complete html to the SEO robot.

### What I learned?
Building this project I learn a lot about SEO and how Google index and rank our pages.
I learn a lot as well about the Azure internals and its app service.

#### Tech
- Azure Cloud Services
- ASP MVC (Web API)
