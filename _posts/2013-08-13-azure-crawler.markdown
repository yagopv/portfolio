#### What is this?
If you are developing applications using  modern JavaScript frameworks like Angular you probably already know that this type of applications are not crawlable by search engine robots without a couple of extra steps.

Azure Crawler exposes an API built on top of ASP .NET executing a phantom headless browser which allow to crawl pages and render the complete html to the SEO robot.

### What I learn?
Building this project I learn a lot about SEO and how Google index and rank our pages.
I learn a lot as well about the internal of Azure and its app service.
