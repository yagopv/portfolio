#### What is this?
BgEngine is a blog engine built using ASP MVC and Entity Framework. The application allow users to create blog posts, image galleries and video galleries in an easy way. This is an open source project.

#### What i learned?
I improved a lot my skills with .NET technologies. Before building BgEngine I worked quite a bit with ASP .NET Webforms and I donÂ´ really like it. ASP MVC is a breeze to develop with in comparison.

I explored a lot of patterns while creating BgEngine as UnitOfWork and Repository. The engine is based in this patterns.
