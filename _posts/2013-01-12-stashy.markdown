#### What is this?
Stashy is a collection of components for doing responsive things. This is a library aiming to help with responsive designs.
In this library you'll find layouts and utilities useful for responsive designs.

#### What I learn
 Developing this library I really learn a lot about responsive design patterns and best practices. I had to do a lot of research in order to create useful, well designed components.
